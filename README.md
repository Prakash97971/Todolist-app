## iTask - Your Personal Todo List Manager

iTask is a full-stack web application designed to help users create, view, update, and delete their daily tasks in an intuitive interface.

---

## Overview

iTask provides a simple and responsive UI for managing todos. It features a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB for data persistence, and a React front-end for interactive task management.

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete todos.
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark tasks as completed and optionally hide/show completed items.

## What the Project Does

- Fetches all todos from the backend and displays them in a list.
- Allows users to add new todos with unique IDs and a default `iscompleted` status of `false`.
- Enables marking todos as completed or uncompleted, updating both UI and database.
- Supports editing the existing todos.
- Offers a toggle to show or hide completed tasks.
